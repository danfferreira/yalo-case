# Yalo-Case  
**Case for Yalo's Analytics Engineer Position**  

Each answer is organized inside a folder corresponding to the respective task.
I decided to use a repository to make it easier to identify and to be closer to a development environment (Git everywhere!).

## Repository Structure  

I divided in folders, for each requested task:

- **Task #1**  
  - All queries were tested in **Google BigQuery**.
  - The queries with comments are in the folder related to Task 1

- **Task #2**  
  - Contains two PDF files:  
    - One with the **overall documentation**.
      - There, I detail my premises, decisions, layers and the architecture.     
    - Another with the **Entity Map** alone, with the relationships in Star Schema.  

- **Task #3**  
  - Includes a **Dockerfile** to set up a **PostgreSQL instance** for working with the provided data.
    - You can clone the repository and use a **docker compose up -d** to create a local PostgreSQL.
    - The **CREATE TABLE** and **INSERT INTO** statements are in the folder as well. You can run it in a SQL Workbench (I used DBeaver) and replicate the query results 
  - The queries with comments are in the folder related to Task #3. 

- **Task #4**  
  - Since Looker access was not available, the solution was based on the **official documentation**.  

Thanks for your time!
